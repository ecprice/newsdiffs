Requirements
------------

You need to have installed on your local machine
* Git
* Python 2.6 or later
* Django and other Python libraries

On a Debian- or Ubuntu-based system, it may suffice (untested) to run
```
  $ sudo apt-get install git-core python-django python-django-south python-simplejson
```


On Mac OS, the easiest way may be to install pip:
  http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html
and then
```
  $ pip install Django
```


Initial setup
-------------

```
  $ python website/manage.py syncdb && python website/manage.py migrate
  $ mkdir articles
```


Running NewsDiffs Locally
-------------------------

Do the initial setup above.  Then to start the webserver for testing:

```
  $ python website/manage.py runserver
```

and visit `http://localhost:8000/`


Running the scraper
-------------------

Do the initial setup above.  You will also need additional Python
libraries; on a Debian- or Ubuntu-based system, it may suffice
(untested) to run
```
  $ sudo apt-get install python-bs4 python-beautifulsoup
```

on a Mac, you will want something like

```
 $ pip install beautifulsoup4
 $ pip install beautifulsoup
 $ pip install html5lib
```

Note that we need two versions of BeautifulSoup, both 3.2 and 4.0;
some websites are parsed correctly in only one version.

Then run
```
  $ python website/manage.py scraper
```

This will populate the articles repository with a list of current news
articles.  This is a snapshot at a single time, so the website will
not yet have any changes. To get changes, wait some time (say, 3
hours) and run 'python website/manage.py scraper' again.  If any of
the articles have changed in the intervening time, the website should
display the associated changes.

The scraper will log progress to /tmp/newsdiffs_logging (which is
overwritten each run) and errors to /tmp/newsdiffs/logging_errs (which
is cumulative).

To run the scraper every hour, run something like:

```
 $ while true; do python website/manage.py scraper; sleep 60m; done
```

or make a cron job.

Adding new sites to the scraper
-------------------------------

The procedure for adding new sites to the scraper is outlined in
parsers/__init__.py .  You need to

1. Create a new parser module in parsers/ .  This should be a
   subclass of BaseParser (in parsers/baseparser.py).  Model it off
   the other parsers in that directory.  You can test the parser
   with by running, e.g.,

   ```
   $ python parsers/test_parser.py bbc.BBCParser
   ```

   which will output a list of URLs to track, and

   ```
   $ python parsers/test_parser.py bbc.BBCParser http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-21649494
   ```

   which will output the text that NewsDiffs would store.

2. Add the parser to 'parsers' in parsers/__init__.py

This should cause the scraper to start tracking the site.

To make the source display properly on the website, you will need
minor edits to two other files: website/frontend/models.py and
website/frontend/views.py (to define the display name and create a tab
for the source, respectively).  Search for 'bbc' to find the locations
to edit.

Note, if you get an error like:

```
UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character ....
```

likely your python is miscofigured such that it is refusing to output utf8 to your
terminal. This happens often on a mac. For a simple workaround, force python into
UTF-8 mode by exporting the following:
```
export PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8
```
