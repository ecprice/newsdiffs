<h1>NewsDiffs |  Tracking Online News Over Time</h1><p>

<h2>	NewsDiffs <a href="http://newsdiffs.org/browse">archives changes</a> in  
articles after publication.<br> Currently, we track
{% for source in sources|slice:":-1" %}
<a href="{% url 'browse' source %}">{{source}}</a>,
{% endfor %}
and
<a href="{% url 'browse' sources|last %}">{{sources|last}}</a>.</h2> 

<p>
<p>NewsDiffs, which was born out of the Knight Mozilla MIT hackathon in June 2012, is trying to solve the problem of archiving news in the constantly evolving world of online journalism.

<p>It was recently added to the thousand sites <a href="http://www.loc.gov/webarchiving/">archived by the Library of Congress.</a><p>
		
<p>The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/01/opinion/sunday/article-changes-are-shown-in-a-tool-created-by-outsiders.html?_r=1">highlighted NewsDiffs</a> in the public 
editor's column (which had <a href="http://nyti.ms/N0VvMq">previously discussed the difficulties of revisions</a> in the digital age). The next New York Times public editor even joined us for a <a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/vote/3910">2013 SXSW panel</a> (<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/jenny8lee/newsdiffs">slides available online</a>)
 
<p>
